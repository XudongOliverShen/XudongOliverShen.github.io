I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National Univeristy of Singapore. I study machine learning with a focus on human and society. Topics include fairness and bias in machine learning. My advisor is professor Mohan Kankanhalli.\nBetween 2015 and 2019, I was an undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, China, majoring in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. The research areas that I have had the chance to work on are computational fluid dynamics, hydrodynamically focused printing, satellite remote sensing, and public policy. I am fortunate to have been supervised/advised by professor Sachiko HIRAKAWA, professor Gerd Grau, and professor Gang Zheng.\nDuring my undergraduate study, I had some of the best times at Trento University (Italy), Waseda University (Japan), and York University (Canada). These short-term stays are supported by Erasmus+, Master Kong Dream Scholarship, and Mitacs Globalink, respectively, for which I am very grateful.\nIf you are interested, I\u0026rsquo;ve written something more about myself\u0026hellip;\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/xudong-shen/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/xudong-shen/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
