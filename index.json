[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hello! I’m Xudong Shen (沈旭东). Friends also call me Oliver. I’m finishing my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore, advised by Professor Mohan Kankanhalli. My research has focused on the technical social alignment of AI, particularly in fairness, and AI governance. I actively contribute to open-community projects, such as inverse scaling, BIG-bench, and natural language instructions. I also organize the algorithm, law, and policy working group at EAAMO bridges (formerly MD4SG).\nFrom 2022 to 2023, I interned at Sea AI Lab in Singapore, working with Chao Du and Tianyu Pang. From 2015 to 2019, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, China, majoring in Naval Architect and Ocean Engineering. During this period, I explored topics such as computational fluid dynamics, satellite imaging, and policy research. My cv is here.\nRecently, I’ve become deeply interested in a new category of social risks from AI, known as AGI risks, or catastrophic risks and superalignment. These risks are theorized to arise with future human-level and superhuman AI, yet it is striking how some\u0026mdash;such as sycophancy, situational awareness, and reward hacking\u0026mdash;have already shown signs of reality in today\u0026rsquo;s AI. Current safety and alignment research is not well-positioned to address these risks for future superhuman AI. I am actively seeking opportunities to (1) do grounded research on AGI risks with actual AI systems and (2) to develop methods that are more likely to be effective for superhuman AI. Please do get in touch if you share the same interest or know of any opportunities. I truly appreciate it.\nIf you are interested, I\u0026rsquo;ve written something more about myself\u0026hellip;\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/xudong-shen/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/xudong-shen/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello!
